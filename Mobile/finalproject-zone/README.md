## Purpose
The purpose of the final project is to apply mobile programming knowledge by designing and developing a real-life mobile app. This is a semester-long course project. Each group will consist of 4 members.

You can come up with a new idea as your final project. We will discuss more in class. Please avoid To-Do, clock, timer-related apps, or any easy app. Take this course project as a challenge and solve a realistic problem. It might even be your startup venture idea.
