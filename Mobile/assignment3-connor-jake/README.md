<h1 align="center">Assignment 3: Practice Firebase with login functionality (Not Built-in Firebase Authentication)</h1>
<h2 align="center">Points: 10</h2>

**Assignment Description:**

In the third assignment, we'll practice one of the core concepts in android development: Login functionality. It is one of the most common features in almost all apps. You can follow my lectures and utilize the provided codes. 

If you want help, please feel free to show your code to others or ask for help in our online discussion forum. If you work on your solution for a few hours and are still not done, you can turn it in, and we will award you credit. 

**In order to complete this activity, you need to take the following steps:**
1. You will need to create a project named **Firebase_Yourname_Partnername** in android studio. 
2. In the MainActivity, you have the app name(CSUSM) and the app’s logo (CSUSM logo). Below the page, you have two buttons named Signup and Login. 
3. If you click the Signup button, it will go to another activity or fragment, where you will insert Email, Password, Confirm Password, Your Full name by pressing a button named “Create Account.” You have to verify the password with a confirm password field.  Pressing the “Create account” button will save the data into the firebase database. It will give an alert message or Toast message (You successfully created an account into the awesome app) once you successfully store the data into Firebase.
4. If you click the Login button, it will go to another activity or fragment. Here, you will enter your email id and password. If your entered information matches with your stored credentials, you will go to another activity and just display a message. **Hello CS481**. If your credentials don’t match, you will give an alert message: “Either your id or password is incorrect”.

**For submitting the project, you have to follow three steps:**

1. Make a small video showing your program functionality in the emulator and show your code as well. 1~2 minutes video is fine. 
2. Please take screenshots of the Kotlin code including the left bar of IDE, test the running console, and then make a PDF file like Class Activities. At the top of the file, please mention both partners' names. 
3. **You have to upload the PDF and Video into your Canvas.**
4. Push your code, pdf, and video in this Github for your future reference.

It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive credit. Your code will not be graded on style, but we still encourage you to follow a good overall coding style for your own sake.
